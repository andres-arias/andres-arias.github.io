I"€<p>Hello! Iâ€™m AndrÃ©s Arias, and Iâ€™m a Computer Engineer from Costa Rica.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="https://www.home.neustar/">Neustar</a> as a Software Engineer,
mainly working with DevOps technologies. On the past, I worked on Embedded
Systems, mainly software targeted to microcontrollers for industrial and
commercial applications.</p>

<p>Computing has always been my passion, so I started this website <em>(after
several tries)</em> to write about the experiments I work on and the things Iâ€™m
learning. Hopefully, something in here will be useful for someone, or at least
entertaining.</p>

<p>Topics Iâ€™m mostly interested in: Computer Architectures, Programming Languages,
DevOps and Embedded Systems.</p>

<p>Also, Iâ€™m part of a hackerspace in San JosÃ©, Costa Rica. They are pretty cool,
