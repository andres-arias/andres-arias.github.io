Hello! So this is my third attempt at starting a
*mainly technical* blog, I hope this is the one that I keep.
I thought that maybe a good idea would be 
to start this blog with a brief post of what I'm trying to accomplish
here.

I always liked the idea of having my personal website where I can
showcase the different personal project I attempt, also I like writing
and hopefully, by writing on this website, I will get better at it. I
chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as my framework, mainly because
it's free, simple to maintain and I can host the resulting site
for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I'm not gonna lie, the first time I tried to create a website
with Jekyll was not as smooth as I expected, mainly because
I'm not familiar with Ruby's ecosystem (Which I hope to be 
soon because learning Ruby is one of my New Year's Resolutions).

After my first failed attempt to get a Jekyll workflow I feel 
comfortable maintaining, I found [Octopress](http://octopress.org/),
which was basically Jekyll wrapped with a lot of fancy stuff, like
simplified deployment using Rake. The resulting site looked nice,
however, I did not really liked the way the website was deployed.

Finally, I found [Poole](https://getpoole.com/), which is just 
Jekyll all set up and running, just fork and run, and that was 
the one I ended up using for this website. Just push to `master` and that's
it. That's definitely something I can get behind.

Okay, back to the original topic I was trying to address: What I want this
site to be. As you might already noticed after 3 paragraphs on how I
built this site, I like writing about software development. Think of
this website as a place where I'll be writing about the technologies
I like, the projects I attempt and the things I'm going to learn (I'm
looking at you Ruby!). Not only writing helps me remember stuff,
I also hope that one day my technical writeups are useful to someone. I
can't count how many times a personal tech blog helped me 
get out of a problem I was stuck on.

So that's it! That's my blog, hopefully I keep it updated and learn 
more while maintaining it.
