title: About Andrés
---

Hello! I'm Andrés Arias, and I'm a Computer Engineer from Costa Rica.

I work at [Neustar](https://www.home.neustar/) as a Software Engineer,
mainly working with DevOps technologies. On the past, I worked on Embedded
Systems, mainly software targeted to microcontrollers for industrial and
commercial applications.

Computing has always been my passion, so I started this website *(after
several tries)* to write about the experiments I work on and the things I'm
learning. Hopefully, something in here will be useful for someone, or at least
entertaining.

Topics I'm mostly interested in: Computer Architectures, Programming Languages,
DevOps and Embedded Systems.

Also, I'm part of a hackerspace in San José, Costa Rica. They are pretty cool,
[check our website and gives us a visit](https://wiki.jaquerespeis.org)!
