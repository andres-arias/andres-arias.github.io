Hello! I'm Andrés Arias, I'm a Computer Engineer from Costa Rica working
as an Embedded Software Engineer for R&D at
[Boston Scientific](https://www.bostonscientific.com/)

I used to work at [Neustar](https://www.home.neustar/) as a Software Engineer,
mainly working with DevOps technologies. Also, on the past, I worked at
[Lantern Technologies](https://lantern.tech), a Costa Rican startup, writing
firmware for IoT devices mainly targeted at industrial and commercial applications.

Computing has always been my passion, so I started this website *(after
several tries)* to write about the experiments I work on and the things I'm
learning. Hopefully, something in here will be useful for someone, or at least
entertaining.

Topics I'm mostly interested in: Computer Architectures, Programming Languages,
DevOps and Embedded Systems.

Also, I'm part of a hackerspace in San José, Costa Rica. They are pretty cool,
